Problem Statement 9: Multi-Agent AI System for Intelligent Resume Parsing, Skill-Set Matching, and API-Ready Talent Intelligence
Description
Recruitment and talent acquisition teams process thousands of resumes daily across diverse formats (PDF, DOCX, LinkedIn exports, plain text), each with inconsistent layouts, terminology, and skill representations. A candidate might list 'React.js' while a job description requires 'ReactJS' or 'React'; one resume uses 'ML Engineering' while the skill database categorizes it as 'Machine Learning Engineering.' Current ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) rely on rigid keyword matching that misses qualified candidates and surfaces irrelevant ones, leading to poor hiring outcomes and wasted recruiter time.

Your challenge is to build a Multi-Agent AI system that intelligently parses resumes from multiple formats, extracts and normalizes skills against a structured skill-set taxonomy, performs semantic matching against job descriptions and role requirements, and exposes the entire pipeline through well-documented REST APIs for seamless third-party integration by HR platforms, job boards, and enterprise systems.

Challenge Requirements
1.
Multi-Format Resume Parsing Agent: Build a specialized parsing agent that extracts structured information from resumes in PDF, DOCX, and plain text formats. The agent must handle diverse resume layouts (single-column, multi-column, creative designs, tabular formats) and extract: personal information (name, contact, location), work experience (company, role, duration, responsibilities), education (institution, degree, field, year), skills (technical and soft), certifications, projects, and publications. Use a combination of layout analysis (for PDFs), NLP-based section detection, and LLM-powered extraction to handle edge cases and ambiguous formatting.

2.
Skill Taxonomy and Normalization Agent: Build a skill normalization agent that maintains a hierarchical skill-set database (e.g., 'Python' -> 'Programming Languages' -> 'Technical Skills') and maps extracted resume skills to canonical entries. The agent must handle: synonyms and abbreviations ('JS' = 'JavaScript', 'K8s' = 'Kubernetes'), skill hierarchy inference (someone with 'TensorFlow' and 'PyTorch' experience implies 'Deep Learning' proficiency), proficiency level estimation based on context (5 years of Python experience vs. 'familiar with Python'), and emerging skill detection (flagging skills not yet in the taxonomy for human review and addition).

3.
Semantic Skill-to-Job Matching Agent: Build a matching agent that goes beyond keyword matching to perform semantic similarity between candidate skill profiles and job requirements. Implement: vector embedding-based skill matching (using sentence transformers or domain-specific embeddings), weighted scoring that considers skill importance (required vs. nice-to-have), experience depth weighting (years of experience, project complexity), gap analysis that identifies missing skills and suggests upskilling paths, and a configurable matching threshold that balances precision vs. recall based on hiring manager preferences.

4.
Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer: Design and implement an orchestration framework where the parsing, normalization, and matching agents collaborate through a shared message protocol. The orchestrator should: manage agent lifecycle and task delegation, handle concurrent resume processing (batch mode for bulk uploads), implement retry logic and graceful degradation (if one agent fails, partial results are still returned), and provide observability with per-agent execution traces, latency metrics, and quality scores. Use a framework such as LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or a custom orchestrator.

5.
API Layer for Third-Party Consumption: Expose the entire pipeline through a production-grade REST API (OpenAPI/Swagger documented) with endpoints for: single resume parsing (POST /api/v1/parse with file upload), batch resume processing (POST /api/v1/parse/batch with async job tracking), skill profile retrieval (GET /api/v1/candidates/{id}/skills), job matching (POST /api/v1/match with candidate ID and job description), skill taxonomy browsing and search (GET /api/v1/skills/taxonomy), and webhook callbacks for async processing completion. Implement API key authentication, rate limiting, request validation, and comprehensive error responses. Provide SDKs or code examples in Python and JavaScript for easy integration.

Suggested Datasets
A synthetic resume dataset (500+ resumes across 10+ industries in PDF and DOCX formats with varying layouts), a structured skill taxonomy database (5,000+ skills organized hierarchically across technology, business, and domain categories), DETAILED job descriptions (100+ across engineering, data science, product management, and design roles), and a ground-truth matching dataset for evaluation (expert-labeled candidate-job compatibility scores).

Technology Requirements
Python (LangChain/LangGraph or CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration, sentence-transformers for embeddings, pdfplumber/PyMuPDF for PDF parsing, python-docx for DOCX parsing), a vector database (ChromaDB, Pinecone, or Weaviate) for skill embeddings, PostgreSQL for structured data, FastAPI for the API layer with OpenAPI documentation, Redis for job queuing and caching, and Docker/Docker Compose for deployment.

Evaluation Criteria
Resume parsing accuracy (field-level F1-score on ground-truth labeled resumes), skill normalization precision (correct canonical mapping rate), matching quality (NDCG and correlation with expert rankings), API completeness (endpoint coverage, documentation quality, error handling), multi-agent orchestration reliability (success rate under concurrent load), and end-to-end latency (single resume processing time < 10 seconds).
